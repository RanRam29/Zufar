"""Database configuration for the casualty management application.

This module provides a SQLModel engine and helpers for creating
sessions. The database URL is read from the ``DATABASE_URL``
environment variable. For development the default is a SQLite file
named ``casualties.db`` in the current working directory. In
production (for example on Render.com) you should set
``DATABASE_URL`` to a PostgreSQL connection string.

The ``init_db`` function is called at application startup to create
tables if they do not already exist. For complex schema evolution
consider using Alembic migrations instead of automating table
creation.
